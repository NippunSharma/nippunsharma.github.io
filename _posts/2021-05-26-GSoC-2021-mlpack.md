I am pleased to announce that my project [`Revamp mlpack bindings`](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6422064107356160) has been selected for GSoC 2021.

I would like to thank everyone at mlpack for choosing my project. My special thanks to [Ryan Curtin](https://github.com/rcurtin) for taking out time to review my proposal as well as PR's to provide
valuable insights.

I will be working on improving python bindings of mlpack to make them more interactive and user-friendly.

Looking forward to a great summer!!
