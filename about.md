![Me playing drums](/public/pp.png)

Hi, I am a Computer Science Undergraduate at [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/).
I am majorly interested in applying machine learning models
to real world data. I like to go into the details of how these
models work. 


I mostly code in python and c++ (I have no particular 
choice between these two, each has its own advantages). Naturally, I
also like to work with [cython](https://cython.org/).


As you can already tell from the picture, drumming is one of my hobbies.
I am also excited about driving.
