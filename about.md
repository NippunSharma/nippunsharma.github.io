Hi, I am a Computer Science Undergraduate at IIT Mandi.
I am majorly interested in applying machine learning models
to real world data. I like to go into the details of how these
models work. 
I mostly code in python and c++ (I have no particular 
choice between these two, each has its own advantages). Naturally, I
also like to work with [cython](https://cython.org/).
As you can already tell from the picture, drumming is one of my hobbies.
I am also excited about driving.
